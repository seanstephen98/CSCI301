"""
    how the loop works::
    for each transaction in transactions, each user will look for an appropriate nonce and create a proposed block if found

        this is broadcasted to the other user's pubnub channels and each user's pubnub listener will send the received block to a handler listener_arbitrator_winner class

        the threads are then joined and then the handler class will compare the two received blocks and determine which block came first

        this does not ensure that the block is "verified" in accordance to lab 4 task 8's method of checking the hash of the previous block against the hash included in the current block

        as spoken with the tutor, the "winning" block will still need to be verified by each user

        if the winning block can be verified, it will be saved by both users

        if the winning block can not be verified, the losing block will be verified

        if the losing block can not be verified, the two users compete to find a valid block again
